1) complex matrix
   # Inner product & length ||x||^2 = x^T * x
   # Length of complex vector ||x|| = x-^T * x
   # checking these function x*y = (x*y)--
       x*cy = c*xy
       cx*y = c-*xy
   # conjugate of transpose A^*
   #   CHECK A** = A
        (AB)* = A*B*
        Real case value 
        A^T^T = A
        (AB)^T=A^T*B^T
   # Inner Product = x.y = x*y
 
 2) Hermintian Matrix
    If matrix A* = A then it is a Hermintian Matrix.
    
   # Properties of hermintian matrix
        Diagonal values of Hermintian matrix is always real.
