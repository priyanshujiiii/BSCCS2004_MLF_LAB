<div><h2>The objective function is needed to solve the optimization problems. A linear representation of the form Z = ax + by, where a, b 
  are constraints, and x, y are variables, which have to be maximized or minimized is called an objective function.</div></h2>
<div><h2>A minimum or a maximum is called an extreme point.</div></h2>
<h2> main function is a function on whic going for optimization</h2>
<h2>We say a system is running at optimal functionality when the goals are satisfactorily achieved with minimum effort and cost as far as the inputs are concerned in a given environment</h2>

<h2>For the standard minimization linear program, the constraints are of the form  ax+by≥c , as opposed to the form  ax+by≤c  for the standard maximization problem. if we use equality then it is possible . Hence True</h2>
