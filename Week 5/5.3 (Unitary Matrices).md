**A unitary matrix is a square matrix of complex numbers, whose inverse is equal to its conjugate transpose.**

An orthogonal matrix is a matrix whose transpose is equal to the inverse of the matrix.

In simple terms, two vectors x and y are said to be “orthogonal” if they make an angle of 90 degrees with each other.

A matrix U is unitary if

>> it is a square matrix and has orthogonal columns

>> it is a square matrix and has orthonormal columns

>> U^*=U

>>U^* = U^{-1}
